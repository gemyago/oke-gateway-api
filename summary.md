# Golang Backend Boilerplate - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This is a production-ready Golang backend boilerplate that follows clean architecture principles and modern development practices. The project is structured to provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable backend services.

## Directory Structure

### Core Directories
- `cmd/` - Application entry points
  - `server/` - Main HTTP server application
  - `jobs/` - Background job processors

- `internal/` - Private application code
  - `api/` - API layer definitions and handlers
  - `app/` - Application core logic
  - `config/` - Configuration management
  - `di/` - Dependency injection setup
  - `diag/` - Diagnostics and monitoring
  - `services/` - Business logic services

### Supporting Directories
- `deploy/` - Deployment configurations and scripts
- `build/` - Build artifacts and scripts
- `.github/` - GitHub workflows and configurations

## Key Configuration Files
- `go.mod` - Go module definition and dependencies
- `go.sum` - Go module checksums
- `.golangci.yml` - Golangci-lint configuration
- `.mockery.yaml` - Mock generation configuration
- `.testcoverage.yaml` - Test coverage configuration
- `Makefile` - Build and development automation

## Development Tools
The project uses several development tools and configurations:
- Golangci-lint for code quality
- Mockery for test mocks
- Comprehensive test coverage setup
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `go mod download`
3. Use make commands for common tasks:
   - `make build` - Build the application
   - `make test` - Run tests
   - `make lint` - Run linters

## Architecture
The project follows clean architecture principles:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependency injection for better testability
- Modular design for scalability
- Internal packages for private implementation

## Best Practices
- Comprehensive linting rules
- Test coverage requirements
- Dependency management
- Structured logging
- Configuration management
- Error handling patterns
- Container best practices
  - Multi-stage builds
  - Minimal base images
  - Security scanning
- Deployment best practices
  - Infrastructure as Code
  - Secret management
  - Rolling updates
  - Health checks

## TODO and Future Improvements
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Add more example services
- [ ] Enhance monitoring setup
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks

## Build System
The build system is located in the `build/` directory and provides:

### Build Configuration
- `build.cfg` - Central configuration file defining:
  - Target platforms for binaries
  - Docker-related settings
  - Build parameters

### Build Components
- `scripts/` - Build automation scripts
  - Python-based build tools
  - Bash utility scripts
  - Test suite for build scripts
- `docker/` - Docker build configurations
  - Multi-platform build support
  - Local and remote image building
- `Makefile` - Build automation commands
  - `make dist` - Build artifacts
  - `make docker/local-images` - Build local Docker images
  - `make docker/remote-images` - Push to registry

### Build Artifacts
- `dist/` - Compiled binaries and assets
- `build-artifacts.tar.gz` - Packaged build outputs
- `.build-artifacts` - Build metadata

## Deployment System
The deployment system is located in the `deploy/` directory and provides:

### Kubernetes Support
- Complete Kubernetes deployment configuration
- Namespace management
- Private registry authentication
- Secret management

### Helm Charts (`deploy/helm/`)
- Production-ready Helm charts
- Environment-specific value files
- Deployment templates for:
  - API services
  - Background jobs
  - Supporting services

### Deployment Tools
- `Makefile` - Deployment automation
- `bin/` - Deployment binary tools
- `.helm-version` - Helm version lock
- Environment configuration (`.envrc`)

### Deployment Workflows
- Local development deployment
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Multi-environment support
  - Development
  - Staging
  - Production

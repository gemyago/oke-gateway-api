# Use this instruction to create pull request

1. Look on a commit history between a base (if not mentioned otherwise, use **origin/main**). You will need to run command like below 
```bash
#  to get current branch, you will use it in step 5
git branch

# git log
git log <base branch>...HEAD --oneline | cat
```

2. Review commit history and come up with a sensible PR title
3. Review commit history and come up with a sensible PR description, it should follow the following format:
  * Short change description 1
  * Short change description 2
  * ...
4. Show PR title and description to the user in the following format:
  ```md
  **PR title**: 
  <PR title>
  ---
  **PR description**: 
  <PR description>
  ```
  Do not present anything else. Ask for confirmation.
5. One confirmed. Push pending changes and create a PR with a command below:
```bash
git push origin <current branch> --set-upstream

gh pr create --title "<PR title>" --body "<PR description>" --base <base branch> --head <current branch>
```
6. Show the PR to the user as a URL so user can click it, as well as full URL for copying.

7. Offer the user to watch for PR status. Wait for confirmation. If confirmed with yes or go, run command below and wait for success or failure result of any step
```bash
gh pr checks --watch
```

Once checks are either succeeded or any of them failed, use command similar below to notify the user:
```bash
say "Cursor speaking. Checks for PR in <project> are <status>"
```
Replace <project> with current github repo name and status with actual status of checks.

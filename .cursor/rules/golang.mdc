# golang project rules

- Build plan, confirm before proceeding
- TDD must be followed if adding new stuff, which means:
  1. Add stub declarations (for struct function panic not implemented)
  2. Add or extend tests that are testing desired logic
    - after extending, show command to run tests in form: 
      `gow test -v ./<package path> --run <test name>`
  3. Implement the logic
- Use mockery to create mocks for dependencies
  - add mocks to @.mockery.yaml
  - run `mockery` from root to regenerate

# golang project rules, apply in agent mode

Please also apply [general.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general.mdc) rules

## common rules
- Honor max line length, it should be 120

## Rules for tests
- define tests in same package
- prefer single top-level function per component and do multiple nested run blocks
- makeMockDeps should be used to initialize dependencies
- when implementing multiple test cases, iterate on each case separately untill it's green
- use require.Error or require.ErrorIs when asserting errors
- use faker (github.com/go-faker/faker/v4) to generate random texts
- when tests ready show command to run tests in form and offer to run it: 
  `go test -v ./<package path> --run <test name>`
- Use mockery to create mocks for dependencies, read [mockery.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/mockery.mdc) prior to using it

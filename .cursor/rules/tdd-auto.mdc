# TDD approach with automated approval

* Write tests first for changes requested
* If logic is complex, split on chunks and do this whole flow for each chunk
* When writting tests, prefer adding new test cases
* Run tests, make sure they are failing with a valid reason
* Update logic as requested, run tests again
* Prefer using faker to generate random data

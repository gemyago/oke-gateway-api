# TDD approach with automated approval

* Use [autonomous.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/autonomous.mdc) rules
* Write tests first for changes requested
* If logic is complex, split on chunks and do this whole flow for each chunk
* When writting tests, prefer adding new test cases
* Run tests before implementing logic, analyse results and make adjustments of tests if needed
* Interate on implementation only after tests have added and executed (previous point)
* Run tests after implementation is ready, analyse results
* Use faker to generate random variables of fields
* If you need to update mocks, please read [mockery.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/mockery.mdc)
